      About me
    </header>
    <p>
      I am a rising senior at Rice University studying Computer Science with minors
      in Data Science and Statistics. I was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana but
      grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina. In my free time, I enjoy watching and playing
      sports, playing video games and hanging with my friends.

      Experiences
    </header>
    <p>
      I have experiences in two main fields - sports analytics and software engineering. In the summer following
      my freshman year, I worked for the Texas Rangers Baseball Club as a Baseball Operations Apprentice working
      closely with the analytics and computer systems teams. During the Covid Summer of 2020, I did freelance work
      for a friend who is an analyst at the Baltimore Ravens. Both of those experiences gave me valuable knowledge of
      the sports industry and allowed me to combine my computer science and analytics skills into some very
      interesting projects. In the Summer of 2021, I interned as a software engineer intern at Tableau. This was an
      incredible experience where I learned a so much about what it is like to be a software engineer for a big company and
      allowed me to put my computer science skills to the test.

      About this site
    </header>
    <p>
      I built this site from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge I gained from
      the free courses on <a href="https://www.codeacademy.com" target="_blank">CodeAcademy</a> because
      I wanted to learn web development and how to build a simple website. I
      hope to use this website as a way to display work that I do independently
      from school that I am interested in sharing with the world.

      What's next for this site
    </header>
    <p>
      In the future, I hope to upgrade the looks of this site. Right now, I will admit that it does not look
      amazing. But, I built it from scratch and was more focused on creating something functional that would allow
      me to talk about and display what I had been working on.
